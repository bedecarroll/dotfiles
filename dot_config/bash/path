# How to debug PATH
#
# The load order is generally:
#
#   * /etc/profile
#   * ~/.bash_profile
#   * ~/.bash_login
#   * ~/.profile
#   * ~/.bashrc
#   * Any scripts sourced in ~/.bashrc
# https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html
#
# With this in mind you can see what is in PATH with:
# 
# echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
#
# If there are duplicates it is probably one of the files
# in the list not checking before adding to PATH. You can
# debug what is setting PATH with:
#
# PS4='+$BASH_SOURCE> ' BASH_XTRACEFD=7 bash -xl 7>&2
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/154971
#
# This will show all changes made by various scripts
# during bash start.
# 
# NOTE: Always check before adding to PATH to prevent
# duplicates.

# First match wins so our scripts should be first
if ! [[ "$PATH" =~ "$HOME/.local/bin:" ]]; then
  PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
